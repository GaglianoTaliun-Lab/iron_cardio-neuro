‎**The project’s Abstract:‎‎**  

‎
Background: Iron is an essential mineral that supports numerous biological ‎functions. ‎Studies have reported associations between iron dysregulation and certain ‎‎cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). However, the ‎‎direction of influence between iron levels and these diseases is not clearly identified. ‎Our ‎goal was to use computational genetic approaches to better understand the role ‎of iron ‎levels on CVD and NDD risk.  ‎  

Methods: We meta-analyzed genome-wide association study summary statistics for ‎‎serum iron levels from four cohorts or previously published meta-analyses. We ‎obtained ‎summary statistics from 11 traits linked to CVD or NDD, and assessed ‎global and ‎regional genetic correlation between iron levels and these traits. We then ‎used two-‎sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate causal effects between ‎iron levels and ‎the 11 CVD or NDD traits. We also carried out sex-stratified ‎analyses to supplement our ‎primary analysis to identify potential sex-specific links. ‎  

Results: Overall, global genetic correlation analysis identified three significant ‎‎correlations: between iron levels and (i) coronary heart disease, (ii) triglycerides, ‎and (iii) ‎high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. A total of 194 regions ‎‎(after correction ‎for multiple testing) had significant local correlations between iron ‎levels and CVD or ‎NDD traits. MR analysis revealed three potential causal ‎relationships, specifically, ‎between genetically predicted iron levels and (i) total ‎cholesterol, (ii) low-density ‎lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and (iii) nonHDL. Sex-‎stratified analyses did not yield ‎significant MR results.  
‎
Impact: Our results will contribute to a better understanding of the genetic basis ‎‎underlying iron and CVD and NDD, and to the search for new preventive ‎interventions and ‎therapeutic avenues for these diseases which affect many people, ‎particularly the elderly
