‎**Abstract:‎‎**  

Background: Iron is an essential mineral that supports numerous biological functions. Studies have reported associations between iron dysregulation and certain cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, but the direction of influence is not clear. Our goal was to use computational approaches to better understand the role of genetically predicted iron levels on disease risk. 

Methods: We meta-analyzed genome-wide association study summary statistics for serum iron levels from two cohorts and two previous meta-analyses. We then obtained summary statistics from 11 neurodegenerative, cerebrovascular, cardiovascular or lipid traits to assess global and regional genetic correlation between iron levels and these traits. We used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate causal effects. Sex-stratified analyses were also carried out to identify effects potentially differing by sex.

Results: Overall, we identified three significant global correlations between iron levels and (i) coronary heart disease, (ii) triglycerides, and (iii) high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. A total of 194 genomic regions had significant (after correction for multiple testing) local correlations between iron levels and the 11 tested traits. MR analysis revealed two potential causal relationships, between genetically predicted iron levels and (i) total cholesterol or (ii) nonHDL. Sex-stratified analyses suggested a potential protective effect of iron levels on Parkinson’s disease risk in females, but not in males.

Impact: Our results will contribute to a better understanding of the genetic basis underlying iron in cardiovascular and neurological health in aging, and to the eventual identification of new preventive interventions or therapeutic avenues for diseases which affect women and men worldwide.
